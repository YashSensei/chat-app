# 🚧 Go (Gin) Backend Migration In Progress 🚧

A new Go backend is being developed to replace the Node.js backend. The Go backend will be located in the `go-backend/` directory and will use Gin-Gonic and MongoDB. All features and endpoints will match the current Node.js backend for seamless integration with the frontend.
